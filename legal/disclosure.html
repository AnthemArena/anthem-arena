            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>What this means:</strong> When you click on an Amazon link on our site and make a purchase, we receive a small commission from Amazon. This commission comes at no extra cost to you—the price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our link or go directly to Amazon.

            <h3 class="section-subheading">What We Recommend and Why</h3>
            
            <p class="content-text">
                We only recommend products and resources that we believe will genuinely benefit League of Legends fans and music enthusiasts. Our recommendations are based on:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><strong>Relevance to League Music</strong> - Products that meaningfully contribute to enjoying League of Legends music and culture</li>
                <li><strong>Quality of Content</strong> - Official merchandise, music albums, and resources that fans will appreciate</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>Our editorial independence:</strong> Affiliate commissions never influence tournament results, voting outcomes, or editorial content. Tournament winners are determined entirely by community votes.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subheading">Where You'll See Affiliate Links</h3>

<p class="content-text">
    We currently feature affiliate links in the following places:
</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
    <li><strong>Post-Vote Book Recommendations</strong> - After voting in a match, you may see a book recommendation modal featuring League of Legends novels and art books</li>
    <li><strong>Music Gallery Cards</strong> - Some music videos in our gallery include relevant book recommendations</li>
    <li><strong>Match Pages</strong> - Book recommendations may appear alongside match information when relevant to the featured songs</li>
</ul>

            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subheading">Non-Affiliated Content</h3>
            
            <p class="content-text">
                The majority of our content—including tournament brackets, voting pages, match archives, and music video galleries—contains no affiliate links whatsoever. Our primary mission is to celebrate League of Legends music through community engagement, not to sell products.
